# URGENT: Cloudflare Pages Configuration Fix

## 🚨 The Issue
Cloudflare Pages is trying to use Wrangler (Workers tool) instead of the standard Pages build process.

## ✅ Solution Steps

### 1. Verify Project Type
- Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → **Pages** (NOT Workers)
- Make sure you're in the correct section

### 2. Delete and Recreate Project (if needed)
If you accidentally created it as a Workers project:
1. Delete the current project
2. Create a new **Pages** project
3. Connect your GitHub repository: `billgalloway/aituki-react-app`

### 3. Correct Build Settings
```
Framework preset: Create React App
Root directory: AiTuki react
Build command: npm run build
Build output directory: build
Node.js version: 18
```

### 4. Environment Variables
```
NODE_VERSION = 18
CI = false
```

### 5. Alternative Build Command
If still failing, try:
```
Build command: npm run build:cloudflare
```

## 🔍 Key Points
- This is a **React app**, not a Workers project
- Use **Pages** deployment, not Workers
- The build works locally (tested ✅)
- The issue is in the Cloudflare dashboard configuration

## 📞 If Still Failing
The problem is definitely in the Cloudflare Pages dashboard settings, not the code. Double-check you're using **Pages** not **Workers**.
